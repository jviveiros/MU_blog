# README

This app is running on rails 5.0.1 and uses PostGres as the database. The front-end is embedded ruby for now with some vanilla javascript to come.

The purpose of this app was to build a multi-user blog dedicated to those who have gone through coding bootcamps to share their stories, study tips, job-hunt tips and generally be a go to place for people who have shared a common experience.
